# Streamlit demo

This is a demo I created for the PyJax user group for September 2025.

For this demo I am using Miniconda, streamlit, pandas and matlib.

## Widgets gallery

Run the comprehensive widgets/examples gallery:

```
streamlit run widgets_gallery.py
```

It showcases buttons, inputs, forms, layout, data display, status messages, charts, media, and chat components.
